# SneakAPeek UI

### About:
A web app that allows keeping track of your favourite Twitch streamers. Adding channels into the queue gives the ability to see what the streamers are doing by showing the latest video snapshots on a single page without the need to keep tabs with actual videos open. Refreshing keeps the shapshots up to date. Users can hit the play button on a video once something interesting is seen happening on the image. ~~Embedding videos is also a good way to keep the twitch ads from popping up~~ (No longer using HLS to directly show the stream in HTML5 video due to Twitch CORS, embedding twitch player instead)

### Requires
[SneakAPeek server](https://github.com/arenex/SneakAPeek) running

### To run
1) npm install
2) npm start
