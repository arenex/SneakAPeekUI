# SneakAPeek UI

### About:
A web app that allows keeping track of your favourite Twitch streamers. Adding channels into the queue gives the ability to see what the streamers are doing by showing the latest video snapshots on a single page without the need to keep tabs with actual videos open. Refreshing keeps the shapshots up to date. Users can hit the play button on a video once something interesting is seen happening on the image.

### Requires
